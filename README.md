## Installation

Clone the repository, navigate into the folder, and install the required packages with the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OliverJessen/AI-HC-Project1
cd AI-HC-Project1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Run the different Free and Serial Recall experiments 20 times each. Then, run the analysis Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) to compute accuracy, primacy/recency effects, and other metrics.

## Features

- **Testing:** Run Free and Serial Recall memory experiments under multiple conditions.  
- **Analyzing:** Analyze experiment results for accuracy, primacy, recency, and condition effects.

## Project Structure

- `Analysis/` - Jupyter notebooks for analyzing experiment results (.ipynb files)  
- `Data/` - Input datasets (.csv files)  
- `Experiment_Output/` - Output from experiments (.csv files)  
- `Free_Recall/` - Python scripts for Free Recall experiments (.py files)  
- `Serial_Recall/` - Python scripts for Serial Recall experiments (.py files)
